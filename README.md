# Addison Reyes ~ Data Engineer & Software Developer

Data engineer focused on building reliable and scalable data pipelines. I design and implement systems that move, transform, and serve data efficiently for analytics and production workloads. I also have experience in software development, applying strong programming principles to build robust data solutions and backend services. I care about data quality, performance, and writing code that teams can understand and maintain months down the line.
